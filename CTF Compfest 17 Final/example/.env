# Tick / Timing / Jitter
TICK_SECONDS=300
# Duration of one tick in seconds. Default 300s (≈ 5 minutes).

JITTER_SECONDS=0
# FIXED delay (seconds) BEFORE the first submit in each tick. No randomness.

# Multi-submit control
ATTACKS_PER_TICK=3
# How many submit attempts (batches) to perform in each tick (1..N).
# Flags found this tick are split into this many batches (balanced).

SUBMIT_SAFETY_MARGIN_SECONDS=5
# Seconds reserved at end of tick to avoid overruns. Lower = more time for submits.

PER_SUBMIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=25
# Hard cap (seconds) for each submit attempt including built-in retries/backoff.
# If a submit exceeds this, remaining submits for the tick are aborted.

# Concurrency / Timeouts
MAX_CONCURRENT=6
# Max number of solver subprocesses to run concurrently.

SOLVER_TIMEOUT=30
# Per-solver run timeout (seconds). Solver process is killed if exceeded.

# Solver command & paths
SOLVER_CMD=python3
# Command to execute solver. Eg "python3" or "./solver_bin".

SOLVER_PATH=solver.py
# Path to solver script executed for each target: SOLVER_CMD SOLVER_PATH <host> <port>

ENEMIES_FILE=enemys-ip.txt
# File listing enemy targets (one host:port per line). Reloaded each tick.

# Logging
ATTACK_LOG=attack.log
# Per-challenge log file. Use unique names per challenge if you run many.

# Backoff (patched/failed hosts)
BACKOFF_BASE_TICKS=1
# Base skip ticks after a failure. skip = BACKOFF_BASE_TICKS * 2^(failures-1)

BACKOFF_MAX_TICKS=12
# Maximum skip ticks for a repeatedly failing host (caps exponential backoff).
